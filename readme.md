A lightweight, privacy-focused analytics platform built using Cloudflare Workers, D1 (SQLite), Drizzle ORM, and Hono. It tracks visitor metadata (location, browser, device, referrer) and provides a developer-friendly CLI to visualize traffic in real time â€” without cookies or intrusive tracking.

Ideal for indie developers, small teams, or internal dashboards who want simple insights without relying on tools like Google Analytics.
